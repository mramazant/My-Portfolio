# My-portfolio

## Project Description:

This project contains information about me and my job. I designed this web page to showcase some of the features I have. In the future, resume will also be added to this page, which contains the projects I have worked on and my contact information.

## Navigation

There is a navigation at the top right and when you click on it, it will take you to the link you want. I made a side section on the left. There you can see my picture and some of the features I have. Right in the middle are the projects that I have worked on. You can find my contact information at the bottom.

Here is a screeshot of Web-Page:
